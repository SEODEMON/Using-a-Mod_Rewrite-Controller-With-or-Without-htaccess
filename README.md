# Using A Mod_Rewrite Controller With or Without htaccess

### This is an example of using a controller for mod_rewrite and other functions like minify HTML, CSS, and sending headers etc...  

### There are a couple of methods that can be used to do this however, according to my research, preg_match() is the fastest method to do this with PHP.

### These are files that I created and I am currently using them on one of my websites.  The script has multiple features which I will come back to and explain later.

### These files give a webmaster a basic understanding of how this can be done. I hope this will help other webmasters. You are welcome to use these files.
